More efficient aircraft maintenance is how airlines can reduce expenses and improve safety. Blockchain technology can deliver through tracking of every part, recording of accurate data on a unified ledger, and lowering costs through efficiency and lighter administration.

Simply put, those in the general aviation industry that adopt blockchain technology sooner rather than later stand to benefit greatly.

Why Blockchain?
Blockchain doesn't just increase trust among producers, suppliers and users, it gives maintenance workers a trustworthy, verifiable and trackable list of information that's available immediately.

This leads to more accurate maintenance operations and greatly decreases operating costs. It makes the entire maintenance function lighter and more efficient.

Even more notable is that blockchain can provide details on the entire life cycle of an aircraft component â€” not just report information while being used on a business jet or helicopter. Blockchain can bring together information from the manufacturer, distributor, installer, inspector and operator. And it can do so digitally, which will massively reduce the overhead of current paper-based methods.

As of now, mostly disparate systems exist for aircraft parts. Manufacturers have their own records and operators have a different one. This means engineer teams can usually only focus on macro issues, like how long the engine has been in use. With blockchain, they have a clear record of every part, allowing them to pinpoint where an issue may be.

This is why blockchain can make aircraft maintenance not just better, but also more cost-effective. Even engineers who haven't worked on the airline can find out what they need by analyzing the ledger, which includes usage data, configuration, repair history and more in a unified record.
